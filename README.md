# Unsupervised machine learning:

Here you can find the papers that I wrote for the subject: Unsupervised Machine Learing during my MA Data Science studies.

The code was written in R language, also there is available a jupyter notebook, in order to find the code together with the analysis.

# What is unsupervised learning?

* Unsupervised learning is a type of self-organized Hebbian learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels. It is also known as self-organization and allows the modeling of probability densities of given inputs. It is one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning has also been described, and is a hybridization of supervised and unsupervised techniques.
